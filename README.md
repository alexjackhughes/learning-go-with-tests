# Learning Go with Tests

_A collection of my experiments learning Go the right way using TDD._

_Most of these examples were written following along with [this guide](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests)._

## Getting Started

**Running Go**

You can run any of the files by calling `go run` followed by the file name like so:

```
go run HelloWorld.go
```

**Running Test Suite**

To run the test suite, you can just run:

```
go test
```
